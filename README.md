## About Me
Hi, I'm Safal Shrestha! I am a Computer Science student at the University of Idaho, interested in software development, programming languages, AI, machine learning, and computational algorithms. Seeking to apply my technical skills in Java, Python, C/C++, and SQL, along with problem-solving and analytical abilities, to contribute effectively to an internship or software development role, Machine Learning and expand my technical expertise.


## Projects

### 1. **Genetic Algorithm for Sequence Alignment**  
ðŸ”¬ *Spring 2025 - Biological Computation Project*  
- Developed a genetic algorithm (GA) to evolve amino acid sequences.
- Implemented a fitness function to favor sequences with hydrophilic ends and a hydrophobic center.
- Used the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm and BLOSUM50 matrix for sequence alignment analysis.
- Visualized fitness trends and alignment scores using `matplotlib`.
- [Project Repository](https://github.com/sthasafal/Genetic-Algorithm )

### 2. **Simplified C-like Language File Reader**  
ðŸ’» *Custom Parser for CCX Language*  
- Designed a file reader to handle token recognition and parsing for a C-like language (CCX).
- Implemented string recognition and enhanced token handling.
